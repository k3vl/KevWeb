                    <p>
                        I am currently a senior and a part of the Engineering Honors Academy at Rutgers University. 
                        I am majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in Computer Science. 
                        I am flexible, disciplined, an excellent problem solver, and can adapt to any situation. 
                        I crave the experience of taking on challenges head-on and doing my best to overcome them. 
                        I enjoy problem-solving and figuring out better ways to approach an issue to help the people around me. 
                        I wish to use my knowledge and experience that I gain to provide some value to anyone or any company I have the pleasure to work with. 
                        I am actively looking for an internship position in the field of Computer Engineering or Computer Science.
